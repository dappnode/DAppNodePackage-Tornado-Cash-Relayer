#### How to use your Tornado Cash relayer over Tor as a hidden service

The relayer uses a self-signed certificate, so anyone (you or anyone using your relayer) will need to accept this certificate first. This certificate is generated by your package and it is not controlled by DAppNode Association, Tornado.cash or any other party: you are its owner and it is safe for you to use.

1. Find out the relayer's .onion address by checking this package's [Logs](http://my.admin.dnp.dappnode.eth/#/packages/tornado-cash-relayer.public.dappnode.eth/logs)
    ```
    #################################################
    Hidden service address:

    http://tcsh5ydwdvd77ui4.onion
    or
    https://tcsh5ydwdvd77ui4.onion


    #################################################
    ```
2. Whoever wants to user the relayer will have to go to the above **https .onion** address connected over Tor. You can do that with the [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) or with [Brave browser](https://brave.com/) > File > New Private Window with Tor)

3. You'll get an error, so you need to click `Advanced` and then `Proceed to tcsh5ydwdvd77ui4.onion (unsafe)` (where tcsh5ydwdvd77ui4.onion is your onion address):

    ***Note**: We need to use an https connection with a self-signed certificate since the connections to the relayer on tornado.cash must use https.*

4. After this you should see this message:

    ```
    This is tornado.cash Relayer service. Check the /status for settings
    ```

    The certificate is now accepted and the relayer will work when used with Tornado.cash.
    
    
    ⚠️Remember that the address of the relayer needs to hold funds to effectively *'relay'*, that is pay the gas to maintain the privacy of the withdrawer ⚠️
    

5. Now that the certificate is accepted, go to Tornado.cash's [website](https://tornado.cash), preferably over Tor. You will need a secret note from your Deposit. To know how to make a deposit in Tornado.cash, please follow their [tutorial](https://tornado.cash/tutorial).

6. Go to the withdraw tab and paste your note.

7. Click on Withdrawal Settings

10. DONE!
